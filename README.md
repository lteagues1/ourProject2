Personal Critique:
Up to this point in class, I feel that my knowledge in html has improved since last semester. I feel more comfortable implementing design components using html and css. However, I need to work on getting more comfortable with adding components using javascript. At this point I better understand that it is good to consistently be mindful of my user when I am designing a site or application. I also understand how the layout, design and interface impacts the users' experience.

Group Critique: Aniello and Arthur did a great job of coding and fixing our code so that the pages in our site were consistent and uniform. They also ensured that our pages were full and the layout was nice. Dayeon did a great job with the code for the schedule. I did a good job with the coding for the login page as well as trying to keep the line of communication with the team open and staying on top of our deliverables.
